## Functionalities

- **TypeScript:** We use TypeScript to add static typing to our code, making it more secure and readable.

- **React Native:** React Native is an open-source framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create cross-platform mobile apps for both iOS and Android using a single codebase, making it efficient and cost-effective.

- **CSS:** We use CSS styles to style our components and create an attractive and responsive interface.

- **Firebase:** We use Firebase's Realtime Database to store the app's data. It's a lightweight and responsive database that allows for real-time synchronization of data across multiple clients, making it a great choice for mobile applications.
